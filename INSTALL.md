Download the code. Before you run anything, make sure to "opam install lwt_ssl lwt_ppx cohttp-lwt-unix opium yojson csv" in the terminal. From there, running "dune exec bin/main.exe" should generate a pop-up window (in VSCODE or the IDE you are using), which contains a button that says "Open In Browser". Clicking on the button will lead you to the demo. Another option to view the demo is to run "dune exec bin/main.exe", open a browser of your choice, and enter "localhost:3000". You must enter "localhost:3000" while your terminal is still performing "dune exec bin/main.exe". These two options should both open the demo.
