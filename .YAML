  Our financial assistant is to create a tool that makes analyzing stock data easy and useful for users. 
  It allows people to enter the stocks they are invested in along with the amount invested in each stock, 
  and get helpful recommendations based on how the stocks are doing. The idea is to keep the interface simple 
  so that anyone, regardless of their financial background, can use the tool to make more informed decisions 
  about their investments. Specifically, we decided to focus on calculating moving averages as a core metric, 
  with many different ratios (like liquidity, profitability, leverage) to give an indication as to whether or 
  not a stock is performing well. The moving average is particularly useful because it smooths out day-to-day 
  price fluctuations and highlights the overall direction of the stock's performance.
