  Our financial assistant is to create a tool that makes analyzing stock data easy and useful for users. 
  It allows people to enter stock symbols, choose time intervals, and get helpful insights like moving 
  averages. The idea is to keep the interface simple so that anyone, regardless of their financial 
  background, can use the tool to make more informed decisions about their investments. Specifically, 
  we decided to focus on calculating moving averages as a core metric, which gives users a clearer 
  picture of stock trends over a period of time. The moving average is particularly useful because 
  it smooths out day-to-day price fluctuations and highlights the overall direction of the stock's 
  performance.
